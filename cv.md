About me
--------
### Over the past 4 years, I have actively taken measures **to improve** internal business processes, **implemented measures** to analyze, optimize and increase their efficiency, participated in rule-making activities at the level of the department and national legislation. **In the winter of 2021, at my own request (due to internal contradictions), I left my previous job**. ###

### **Even while working in the framework of personal growth** and further improvement of personal qualifications, especially in the algorithmicization of bureaucratic processes, **I became interested in programming**. ### 

### During the period of resocialization, taking into account the freed up time, **I decided to continue to be actively interested in this direction**. Over the past year, I got acquainted and acquired **basic programming skills using several languages**, incl. in the context of their standard libraries. The learning process fascinated me greatly, and therefore **I devote a lot of time to this**. ###

### Currently, I am pursuing the goal of acquiring skills in web development at the Junior level, as the first stage, **I see in this a great potential for further development**, further immersion in the industry, as well as creating conditions for ensuring my participation **in the implementation of Web 3.0 projects**. ###

### My personality **strengths** include: ###
- #### focus on achieving a specific result; ####
- #### discipline; ####
- #### ability to plan multi-stage events; ####
- #### **ensure their effective organization and direct control**; ####
- #### in necessary cases, ready to demonstrate **creativity and high variability** in the  development of proposals and the search for possible solutions; ####
- #### **high psychological stability** and diligence. ####
