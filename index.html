            <p>Over the past 4 years, I have actively taken measures <strong>to improve</strong> internal business processes, **implemented measures** to analyze, optimize and increase their efficiency, participated in rule-making activities at the level of the department and national legislation. **In the winter of 2021, at my own request (due to internal contradictions), I left my previous job.</p> 
            <p>Even while working in the framework of personal growth** and further improvement of personal qualifications, especially in the algorithmicization of bureaucratic processes, I became interested in programming.</p>
            <p>During the period of resocialization, taking into account the freed up time, I decided to continue to be actively interested in this direction**. Over the past year, I got acquainted and acquired basic programming skills using several languages, incl. in the context of their standard libraries. The learning process fascinated me greatly, and therefore I devote a lot of time to this.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am pursuing the goal of acquiring skills in web development at the Junior level, as the first stage, I see in this a great potential for further development, further immersion in the industry, as well as creating conditions for ensuring my participation in the implementation of Web 3.0 projects. </p>
            <p>
            My personality strengths include: 
            <ul>
